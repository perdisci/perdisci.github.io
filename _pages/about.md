I am a Professor in the [School of Computing](https://computing.uga.edu){:target="\_blank"} at the
University of Georgia, where I hold the Patty and D.R. Grimes Distinguished
Professorship in Computer Science and direct the [UGA Institute for
Cybersecurity and Privacy](https://cybersecurity.uga.edu){:target="\_blank"}. I am also an Adjunct
Associate Professor in the [Georgia Tech School of Computer
Science](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/){:target="\_blank"} and a faculty member of the [UGA Institute
for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai.uga.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. Before joining UGA I was
Post-Doctoral Fellow at the College of Computing of the Georgia Institute of
Technology, working under the supervision of Prof. Wenke Lee. Before that, I was Research
Scholar at the Georgia Tech Information Security Center and PhD candidate at the
University of Cagliari, Italy with the [Pattern Recognition and Applications
Group](https://pralab.diee.unica.it/en){:target="\_blank"}.


My research focuses on securing networked systems. I am particularly interested in web security, automating the analysis of security incidents, and defending networks from malware. I often combine systems research with machine learning and large-scale data mining techniques to solve challenging computer and network security problems. I am also interested in broader aspects of networked systems, including Internet-scale measurements, analysis and optimization of systems performance, and the design of networking protocols. In 2012, I received an [NSF CAREER award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1149051){:target="\_blank"} on a project titled "Automatic Learning of Adaptive Network-Centric Malware Detection Models."
